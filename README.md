# Advent Of Code 2021 (Clojure)

My solutions to AoC written in Clojure as a learning/practice exercise.

# Input

Inputs should not be published to public git repositories so you'll have to use your own.

The input for a given day goes in:

`day[x]/src/resources/input`

## Running the Code

To generate the answers for an input file:

```bash
clj -X:run 
```

To run the unit tests (assuming I wrote any):

```bash
clj -X:test
```
